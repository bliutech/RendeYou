# Express Backend

## Setup
In this directory, run

    npm install

If scary errors occur, and especially if `package.json` or `package-lock.json`
somehow get modified, **do not push.** Reach out.

Create a `.env`, which we will use to store secret URLs. Therefore, it is
essential that you **not push** the `.env` to the remote.

## Running

    npm start

The backend will be available on http://localhost:3000. Currently, the root
endpoint returns a "Hello World!" message.

## Endpoints

To be documented.
